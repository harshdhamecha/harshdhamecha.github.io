        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Computer Vision Engineer currently working at Matrix Comsec, Vadodara since January 2022. My expertise includes Face Detection, Face and Head Detection, Face Keypoints Detection, and I'm currently working on License Plate Recognition for Middle East countries. I'm also mentoring two colleagues working on Face Occlusion Classification and Face Keypoints Detection.

            I graduated from Marwadi University, Rajkot in 2022 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence with a CGPA of 8.9. During my studies, I served as the Placement Coordinator. Outside of work, I have a passion for cricket and represented our university in the West Zone Inter University Cricket Tournament held in Gwalior.

            I completed my schooling at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya - Rajkot, achieving 82% in class 12th in 2018 and a remarkable 9.8 CGPA in class 10 in 2016. Currently, my work primarily revolves around training CNN models.
